🏠 Housing Price Prediction App

A simple and interactive web application built using Streamlit that predicts housing prices based on various user inputs such as area, number of rooms, location details, and more. The prediction is powered by a pre-trained machine learning model saved as a .pkl file.

🚀 Features
Predict house prices based on key features like:

Society name

Area and area type

Price per square foot

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Floor number

Facing direction

Furnishing status

Age of possession

Additional rooms and balcony information

Real-time predictions with a user-friendly interface

Error-handling and simple encoding for categorical values

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Streamlit – for UI

NumPy – for numerical operations

Pickle – for loading the trained model

Scikit-learn – used in training the model (assumed)

📝 Notes
The model uses a simple hash-based encoding for categorical variables. In a production setup, it's recommended to use consistent and trained encoders (e.g., OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder).
